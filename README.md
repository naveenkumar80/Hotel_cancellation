# Hotel_cancellation
This project analyzes a dataset of hotel bookings obtained from Kaggle to understand the patterns and factors contributing to booking cancellations. The data was cleaned, processed, and visualized through an interactive dashboard to help hotels make data-driven decisions and reduce cancellation rates.
